# SwarmRobot_Simulation
 It focuses on preprocessing high-dimensional data, robot localization, and leveraging alignment, cohesion, and separation vectors to induce non-flocking robots to emulate flocking dynamics. Utilizing the Extra Trees Regressor algorithm, the study classifies swarm behaviors and simulates these behaviors using the Vicsek model.
